### Feedback
Thanks for taking on this challenge, Simon. Your app looked very close to the original
so excellent job in the design and styling of your UI. There were a couple things not working correctly 
with your app such as your pause button. Also, you reset button only reassigns 0, but it keeps incrementing. 
There were also a couple instances where your code was redundant. Another thing I noticed is when the start button is pressed
multiple times it multiplies the incrementation of your timer, which isn't ideal for this kind of timer.
All in all keep pushing yourself to master your JavaScript
